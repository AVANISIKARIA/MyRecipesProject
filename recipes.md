INSTRUCTIONS:
   1)Start the sauce so that it can simmer while you prep everything else. Heat oil in a saucepan and saute onions, garlic and carrots. Once the onions are soft, add tomatoes, tomato puree, water, thyme, oregano, sugar, salt and pepper and let this come to a boil. Then reduce the heat to a simmer and simmer for 20-25 minutes till the tomatoes break down and the sauce is thick.

   2)Heat olive oil in a pan and saute onions and garlic. Add salt and once the onions are translucent, add bell peppers, mushrooms and zucchini. Cook on high heat for 8-10 minutes till the vegetables are cooked and any residual water has evaporated. Season with more salt and pepper if required.

   3)In a bowl mix together blanched spinach, ricotta, parmesan and cream (is using). Refrigerate till ready to use.

Layering the Lasagna:
   1)Preheat oven to 180C/ 350F.
   2)Brush the base of a large baking dish (mine is 12.5 inch by 8 inch) with olive oil. Spoon a ladleful of the sauce at the base and spread it out. Cover the base with lasagna sheets overlapping/tearing as required.
   3)Add all the spinach ricotta mixture and spread it out. Cover with lasagna sheets.
   4)Add the roasted vegetables and spread them out. This will be the thickest layer. Add 2-3 ladles of sauce (approx 1.5 cups) and spread it over the veggies. Sprinkle a cup of cheese.
   5)Layer with lasagna sheets. Add 2 cups sauce on top and spread it out. Sprinkle with remaining cheese
   6)Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the lasagna is baked through (stick a knife in the middle to check - there should be no resistance) and the cheese is golden on top.
   7)This is an important step. Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This helps settle the layers and the lasagna won't fall apart when you serve.

NOTE:
   Spinach: You can also use frozen spinach. Make sure to thaw it fully and squeeze out all the water before using. Do the same with blanched spinach.

   Pasta: If you are using pasta that needs to be pre-cooked, boil according to package directions. Reduce the cooking time to 25 minutes and then check.

   Make Ahead: You can assemble the lasagna and refrigerate for a couple of hours and bake when required.
   
   Storing: The lasagna keeps well in the refrigerator for up to four days. Or you can freeze it for up to 2 months.
